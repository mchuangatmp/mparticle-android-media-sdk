# mParticle Android Media SDK

Hello! This is the public repo of the mParticle Android Media SDK. We've built the mParticle platform to take a new approach to web and mobile app data and the platform has grown to support 50+ services and SDKs, including developer tools, analytics, attribution, messaging, and advertising services. mParticle is designed to serve as the connector between all of these services - check out [our site](http://mparticle.com), or hit us at developers@mparticle.com to learn more.

## Documentation

Fully detailed documentation and other information about mParticle Android SDK can be found at our doc site

-   [Core mParticle SDK](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/android/getting-started)

-   [Media SDK](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/android/media)

# Getting Started

Please be aware that this SDK is built as an extension of and requires the use of the [mParticle Android SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-android-sdk/).

## Include and Initialize the SDK

Below summarizes the major steps to get the Android Media SDK up and running. In addition to the below, we have built a sample app that provides a more in depth look at how to send `MediaEvent`s to Adobe's Heartbeat Kit. See that [sample app here](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-media-samples)

You can grab the Core SDK via Maven Central. Please see the badge above and follow the [releases page](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-android-sdk/releases) to stay up to date with the latest version.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.mparticle:android-media:1.4.0'
}
```




### Code Samples

Starting a MediaSession and logging events. The `MediaSession` fields `title`, `mediaContentId`, `duration`, `streamType`, and `contentType` are all required fields. We reccomend you use the constants defined in `StreamType` and `ContentType` for the `streamType` and `contentType` fields respectively, but free formed Strings are accepted if these constants don't accurately describe your Media

```kotlin
    //initialize the core SDK
    val options = MParticleOptions.builder(context)
        .credentials("key", "secret")
        .build()
    MParticle.start(options)
    
    //initialize a MediaSession
    val mediaSession = MediaSession.builder {
        title = "Media Title"
        mediaContentId = "123"
        duration = 1000
        streamType = StreamType.LIVE_STEAM
        contentType = ContentType.VIDEO
    }
    
    //start the MediaSession
    mediaSession.logMediaSessionStart()
    
    //log events!
    mediaSession.logPlay()
    mediaSession.logPause()
```

Updating playhead position while logging an event

```kotlin
    mediaSession.logPlay(
        Options(currentPlayheadPosition = 120000)
    )
```

Including customAttributes in an event. Common customAttribute keys are available as constants in `OptionsAttributeKeys`, but they may also be free formed Strings

```kotlin
    val options = Options(
            customAttributes = mapOf(
                "isFullScreen" to "true",
                CONTENT_EPISODE to "episode1",
                PLAYER_NAME to "JWPlayer"
            )
        )
    mediaSession.logPlay(options)
```

#### Logging `MediaEvent`s as Custom Events (`MPEvent`) to the MParticle Server

1) Automatically Log all `MediaEvent`s created by the `MediaSession`, as `MPEvent`s

> note: "UpdatePlayheadPosition" `MediaEvent`s will never be automatically logged to the MParticle Server

```kotlin
val mediaSession = MediaSession.builder {
    title = "Media Title"
    mediaContentId = "123"
    duration = 1000
    streamType = StreamType.LIVE_STEAM
    contentType = ContentType.VIDEO
    
    logMPEvents = true
}
```

2) Create a Custom Event(`MPEvent`) within the context of a MediaSession.

```kotlin
val mpEvent = mediaSession.buildMPEvent("Milestone", mapOf(
    "type" to "95%"
  ))
MParticle.getInstance()?.logEvent(mpEvent)
```

3) Log select `MediaEvent`s as Custom Events(`MPEvents`). The example flattens and logs `MediaEvent` created by `MediaSession.logPlay()` calls
```kotlin
mediaSession.mediaEventListener = { mediaEvent ->
    if (mediaEvent.eventName == MediaEventName.PLAY) {
        val mpEvent = mediaEvent.toMPEvent()
        MParticle.getInstance()?.logEvent(mpEvent)
    }
}
```
